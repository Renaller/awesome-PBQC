## Classical Impossibility

- [Position-based Cryptography (2009)](https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-642-03356-8_23) - Establishes classical impossibility of position-based cryptography in the vanilla model. Shows possibility in bounded-storage model.

## First Protocols

- [Tagging Systems (2006)](https://patents.google.com/patent/US20060022832A1/en) - Introduces quantum position verification under the name of 'quantum tagging'.
- [Location-dependent communications using
quantum entanglement (2010)](https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevA.81.042319) - Introduces quantum position verification in the academic literature, but incorrectly claims unconditional security. Studies QPV based on Bell states.
- [Quantum location verification in noisy channels (2010)](https://doi.org/10.1109/GLOCOM.2010.5684009) - Studies QPV based on Bell states, GHZ states and entanglement swapping. Studies the effect of noise/decoherence.
- [Quantum
tagging: Authenticating location via quantum information and rel-
ativistic signalling constraints (2011)](https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevA.84.012326) - Introduces a rooster of different QPV protocols like BB84 QPV, $f$-routing, $f$-BB84 QPV and variations of them. Mentions entanglement-based attacks on some of them.
- [Insecurity of position-based
quantum cryptography protocols against entanglement attacks (2011)](https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevA.83.012322) - Proves insecurity of QPV protocols that were previously claimed secure and studies general principle underlying entanglement attacks. Studies variations of QPV protocols based on Bell/GHZ states and shows that using eigenstates other than Pauli $X$, $Y$, $Z$ leads to protocols that need >1 EPR pair to be attacked.
